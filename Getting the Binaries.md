# Getting the Binaries

## Prerequisites

Install 7-Zip. It is free and open source and will extract the necessary .MSI files.

## Download the Subversion Binaries

Head over to http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html#windows and download the SlikSVN binaries.

Download the 32- and 64-bit version of the binaries.

## Extract the Binaries

Use 7-Zip to extract the .ZIP files. To do so right click the .ZIP file and then select "7-Zip"->"Extract Files...".

This will extract .MSI files. Repeat the extraction step with 7-Zip for the .MSI files as well.

Now you have two directories containing the necessary binaries!
